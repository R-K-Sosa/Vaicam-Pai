# Vaicam Pi Android App on Google Play Store

VAICAM Pi is bundled as an Android mobile app, a Google Cardboard Virtual Reality (VR) headset, and a Raspberry Pi 3 equipped with a 360 camera and Artificial Intelligence to function as your own artificially intelligent security camera. The security system records the entrance of the personâ€™s home, live streams it privately so only the person with the app can view the stream. The app uses an artificially intelligent API that recognizes individuals that walk up the front door, matches them with a database of images of people that the person trusts, and displays matches. As a result, VAICAM Pi fits perfectly in the surveillance camera industry.
